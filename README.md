# Servo_control

This project demonstrates how to control **four servo motors** using an **Arduino Uno**.  
It was simulated using **Tinkercad** and also implemented in real life using a **power bank** as the power source.

---

## Project Preview

- âœ… Simulation done in Tinkercad *(video available)*  
- âœ… Real implementation also recorded in a video

---

## How It Works

Each servo motor is gradually rotated from **0Â° to 180Â°** in steps, then back to 0Â°.  
The motors move **one after the other**, and then all together in reverse.

---

## Components Used

- Arduino Uno  
- 4x Servo motors (SG90 or similar)  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper wires  
- Power source (Power Bank via USB)  
- *Optional:* External power supply for servos (if needed)

## Circuit Details

| Servo | Signal Pin (Arduino) |
|-------|----------------------|
| 1     | D3                   |
| 2     | D5                   |
| 3     | D6                   |
| 4     | D9                   |

 Power and ground for all servos are connected to the breadboard's rails, powered from the Arduino.

## How to Run

1. Connect your circuit as shown.  
2. Upload the `sweep.ino` code to the Arduino Uno.  
3. Watch the servos move sequentially and then return together.
